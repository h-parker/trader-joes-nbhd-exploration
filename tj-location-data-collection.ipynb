    "## Census Data - Found Online, Already Scraped!\n",
    "So, it turns out we don't need to scrape the census data! Hooray! The data (from a site called safegraph) is on census block groups, so all that's left to do is figure out what census block group each TJ address is in. The nice thing about the data being grouped by census block group is that census block groups are designed to be homogenous, so we will likely get a good picture of the area that the TJ's was going for when we look at the data retreived from the census block group it's in. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have the addresses, so we can use the Census Bureau's GEOID lookup (https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder) to find the census block group. Unfortunately, their bulk address lookup is glitchy and doesn't always find addresses that are their system, so we have to scrape this info. Luckily, they save the groups from the 2010 census, so we're not going to see weird changes because of new roads that may have changed census block groups since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "GEOIDs contain the state, country, tract, block group, and block IDs, represented as one long string of digits (in that order). If we take the first 12 digits (going from left to right), that should give us the census block group. (more info on GEOIDs: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) For example, my college's GEOID is: 360550038021000 -- 36 represents the state (NY), 055 represents the county (Monroe), 003802 represents the census tract, and 1000 represents the census block (1 represents the census block group -- all census blocks in a census block group will have the same first digit in their 4 digit census block, and all the numbers before that first digit will be the same). So, if I wanted the census block group data for U of R, I would look up the first 12 digits -- 360550038021 -- and have my results. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are 2 things to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the addresses as a CSV with 'columns' street, city, state, and zip\n",
    "2. Get the GEOID from the census site\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can join each TJ's store with its area's demographic/educational/etc. information on census block group. We'll do that part in another notebook, though, since it's not specific to collecting the data (but rather, cleaning it and making it into something actually useful)."
